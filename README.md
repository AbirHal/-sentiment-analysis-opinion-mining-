 ## The Representations
 ### TF-IDF : term frequency-inverse document frequency
 ### BOW : bag of words
 ### Word2vec 
## Experimenting with an Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM,DT and RandomForest Classifiers:
+ NB: Naive Bayes, BernoulliNB implements the naive Bayes training and classification algorithms for data that is distributed according to multivariate Bernoulli distributions
+ LR:Logistic Regression (aka logit, MaxEnt) classifier.
+ LSVM:Linear Support Vector Classification.
+ DT: decision tree .
+ RF : A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
## Using  Cross Validation for detect overfitting .
